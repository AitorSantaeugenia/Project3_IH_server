Use React for all of the user-facing parts of your application.
Use Express for your API backend that your React app will communicate with.
Use Mongoose for models and database communication.
Have 3 models or more. Having one for users is a no-brainer. The other two should represent the main functionality of your app. Don’t force it if having a 3rd model doesn’t make sense.
Have validation on its models with feedback for users if their submission is invalid.
Include sign up, log in & log out functionality with encrypted passwords (or social logins) and authorization (logged in users can do extra things).
Have two repos on GitHub. One for your React application and the other for your Express API backend.
Have at least 1 commit per day that you worked on it.
Be deployed online using Heroku, so anybody could use your app
